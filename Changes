Revision history for CPAN-Reporter-Smoker-Safer

0.02    2009-01-22
        * Removed ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.48 and perl 5.6.1 version restrictions.
        * Refactored __filter to use Barbie's new http://www.cpantesters.org/cgi-bin/reports-text.cgi api.
            This allowed for the removal of the my*() hack functions.
        * In the default __filter(), unknown upload date or reports counts are treated as untrusted.
        * API change -- changed the custom params to start() from safer__foo=>val key/value pairs to safer=>{}.
        * Pod updates.
